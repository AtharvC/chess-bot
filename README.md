# chess-bot
Try to make a chess bot from the ground up in Java, from the board to the ML functions


<h1> Use the master branch to push/pull your changes AND please name the commit messages properly</h1>

How to get the git repo:

Go to your desktop: Right click -> make a new folder

Now open the folder and while holding **shift** press right click
Then, use whatever command prompt you can access there (Terminal/git bash/anything that gives you the cmdline) and type this:

`git clone --single-branch --branch master git@github.com:AtharvC/chess-bot.git` \*\*

after which you watch magic happen.

After its done, you open IntelliJ -> File -> Open -> select the folder that you created.
After that press `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S` and then go to Project and set the sdk to AdoptJDK14 or any other Java 14 runtime.

**If its asking you to verify, just scroll up on #chess channel, it should be there.

Once you generate those: go to C:\\Users\\*user*\\.ssh
Then edit the .pub file -> copy what's in there

Then go to github account settings -> SSH & GPG keys -> New SSH key
